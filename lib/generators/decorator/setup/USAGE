Description:
    The setup generator creates an /app/decorators folder and
    a /config/initializers/load_decorators.rb initializer.

    Any decorator module in /app/decorators that matches a model name
    will be included into that model.

Examples:
    rails generate decorators:setup

        Folder:      app/decorators
        Initializer: config/initializers/load_decorators.rb
